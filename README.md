# Movie-recommender
Movie recommender, built with numpy library in Python. 

In this project we have two types of recommender, that is called by: **Collaborative Filtering** and **Content-Based Filtering**.

Here you have collaboration as the basis for our filter, if someone likes a video and another user likes it, and if that user likes another video, that video will be shown to the other user as in the illustration.
