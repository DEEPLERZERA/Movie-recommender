# Movie-recommender
Movie recommender, built with numpy library in Python. 

In this project we have two types of recommender, that is called by: **Collaborative Filtering** and **Content-Based Filtering**.

Here you have **collaboration** as the basis for our filter, if someone likes a video and another user likes it, and if that user likes another video, that video will be shown to the other user as in the **illustration**.

Here you have the **similarity** of a video as the basis for our filter, if someone likes a video, and the other video is similar to this video liked by someone, that video will be shown to the user, as is in the **illustration**.
